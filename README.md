# IEM 4013 Project
In our IEM 4013 Operations Research class, we have been tasked with implementing an Integer Program that determines the optimal congressional districts for a state of our choosing.  We have selected Arkansas and used data from the 2020 census to determine an ideal solution.  Code is based on Dr. Austin Buchanan's provided examples.
